# Automatic Advertisement Classification

Business Context:
Craigslist.com is one of the most visited web pages on the internet. An estimated 80 million advertisements are posted monthly. Out of these approximately 7% of ads are misclassified leading to a substantial loss in revenue. Our aim in the project was to develop a framework that identifies misclassified advertisements and puts them into the correct categories. We focused our solution on two categories - cars & general. Geographically our scope was confined to Chicago, Indianapolis and Lafayette (Indiana).

Technical Implementation:
- Manual tagging of close to 6000 ads for model training
- Trained various classification models (linear, bagging, boosting, deep learning)
- Applied Natural Language Processing techniques to train models
- Attained an accuracy of 96% using a Long Short Term Memory model on test sets
- Accuracy of 97.5% using Multi-level Perceptron model on test sets
